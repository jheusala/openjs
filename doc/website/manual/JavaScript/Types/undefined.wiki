== undefined ==

Undefined is a special type that has only one value. All values are undefined 
by default.

 var x; // x is undefined

Undefined is returned by default in most places:

 var obj = {};
 var y = obj.y // y is undefined

 function x() {};
 var y = x(); // y is undefined

When you need to check if a value is undefined it is common practice to declare 
variable undefined without setting value to it.

 var undefined;
 if(x === undefined) return;
